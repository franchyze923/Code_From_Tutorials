FitBit API Info 11/30/2020

https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/#authorization-page
We are using the Implicit Grant Flow. In order to do this, the app must be registered as personal or client. 

First make this request in a browser - 
https://www.fitbit.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=22942C&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ffitbit_auth&scope=activity%20nutrition%20heartrate%20location%20nutrition%20profile%20settings%20sleep%20social%20weight&expires_in=604800
Remember to fill in client_id with your client_id. Also increase time limit (in seconds) if you'd like it to last longer.
86400 for 1 day
604800 for 1 week
2592000 for 30 days
31536000 for 1 year

Allow all in the browser and then copy the access_token value from the response URL in the browser. 

Store the access token in a variable in Python and use it to make requests to the Fitbit API.
